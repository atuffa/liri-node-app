Project for Spotify, Twitter, Omdb Api's 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project built by JavaScript(ES6), API and npm .

This project will help students or anyone new or familiar with the above listed programs. 

It's a back end program in which users input on the editor terminal.  

The user should input in the following manner to get a response from the Api's

    - For Spotify API "node liri.js spotify-this-song" "song name"
    - For OMDBI Movies API "node liri.js movie-this" "movie name"
    - For Twitter API "node liri.js "my-tweets".
    - In order to use the preset request "do-what-it-says"    
    
It is useful to understand or use as a reference for the concept of 

            - NPM 
            - NPM API requests
            - File System 
              - fs Write
              - fs Append
            - dotenv - to set what are known as environment variables
            - JS (ES6)
            - JS String methods
            
            
            
I think this will be a good backend node project that covers most node js topics
